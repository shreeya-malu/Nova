                    <br>
                    <p style="font-family: monospace;">We are a group of enthusiastic students united by our fascination with the universe and its mysteries. Driven by curiosity about what lies beyond the stars, we have come together to build and experiment with model rockets.<br>Our goal is to learn and deepen our understanding of space and rocket science through hands-on experience. By combining our talents and passion, we aim to explore these concepts in a practical, educational way.</p>
